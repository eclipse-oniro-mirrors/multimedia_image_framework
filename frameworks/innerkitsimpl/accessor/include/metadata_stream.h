 * The maximum file size that can be handled depends on the system and compiler:
 * - On a 32-bit system, the maximum file size is 2GB.
 * - On a 64-bit system, the maximum file size depends on whether 'long' is compiled as 32-bit or 64-bit.
 * If 'long' is 32-bit, the maximum file size is 2GB.
 * If 'long' is 64-bit, the maximum file size is 8ZB (Zettabytes).
